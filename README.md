# Vue + GraphQL + Apollo fullstack example

This is a demo application combining Apollo Server as a GraphQL API and a Vue application with Apollo Client on a frontend side. To start a GraphQL server, please run:

```bash
npm run apollo
# OR
yarn apollo
```

The server will be running on `localhost:4000/graphql` and you can find a Prisma playground on this URL as well to check the schema & test queries.

To start the frontend app you should run

```bash
npm run serve
# OR
yarn serve
```

The application will be running on `localhost:8080`.
